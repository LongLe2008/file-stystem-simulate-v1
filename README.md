This is a program that is intended to simulate Terminal. It is simplified, so some commands, such as echo (to files), may not have any overloaded parameters to simplify to a specific directory except for current one. T
his program may also be buggy when you are attempting to nest inside too many folders, but otherwise works on a basic level.
You will need a proper Console to use this program.
